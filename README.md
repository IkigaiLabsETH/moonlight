**Cult Coins: The Future of AI-Native Art and Collectibles**

**Introduction**

Ikigai Labs stands at the intersection of art, technology, and the evolving Web3 landscape, housing a meticulously curated collection of web3-native art produced between 2007 and 2025. This digital museum celebrates the pioneering creativity of the early NFT era but also gazes into the future with a clear focus on Real-World Art (RWA) integrated with TRACE technology. But beyond the museum walls, a new frontier is emerging—the Cult Coins.

**Cult Coins: An Evolution in Art and Technology**

Cult Coins are not just collectibles; they represent a new era of AI-native digital assets. These coins are characters, personas with evolving skill sets, living on Solana. Unlike traditional NFTs, which are often static representations, Cult Coins are dynamic and AI-driven, meaning they grow and adapt over time.

### **Curating the Future**

To bring this vision to life, a decision must be made on how to best utilize our resources. While it's tempting to mint all 100+ AI characters we’ve developed, we must curate this vast collection down to a manageable number—let's say 24—each carefully selected to represent the cutting edge of AI-native art. The curation process isn't just about picking the best images; it's about storytelling.

**The Launch Strategy**

Our plan is to launch these characters in a phased manner. We’ll begin by deploying 8 tickers on Moonshot, our chosen platform for this endeavor. Each ticker represents a unique AI persona, complete with its own image, ticker name, description, and integration with our LiveTheLifeTV social channels like Discord, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook.

### **Interactive Experiences**

What makes Cult Coins truly unique is their interactivity. Each AI persona will have its own dedicated channel on LiveTheLifeTV’s Discord, where collectors and fans can engage directly. These AI-native characters aren’t just static images; they can respond to questions, participate in discussions, and even broadcast messages on X, making them living, evolving entities within the Web3 space.

**Real-World Integration**

While the Cult Coins exist in the digital realm, there’s also a plan for their physical manifestation. Selected characters from the curated collection will be minted on the OG Ethereum network and printed on high-quality materials, thanks to our partnership with WhiteWall. These prints will not only serve as art pieces for collectors but will also blur the lines between the digital and physical worlds.

**Conclusion**

Ikigai Labs is not just a museum—it’s a launchpad for the next generation of AI-native art. As we prepare to mint and launch the Cult Coins, we’re not just creating another set of collectibles; we’re telling a story, curating an experience, and pushing the boundaries of what art can be in the Web3 era.

So, what’s next? We’re fine-tuning the narrative, selecting the personas that will lead this new frontier, and preparing to launch them into the world. Stay tuned to see which characters make the cut and how you can become part of this AI-native revolution.

To build a fine-tuned AI model for each Cult Coin persona, you'll need to create a robust dataset that captures both the skills and personality traits for each role. This dataset will be transformed into JSONL files, which are required for training models on platforms like OpenAI's GPT, Cohere, or similar. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Data Collection**

**1.1 Identify Core Competencies and Personality Traits**
   - **Core Competencies:** Define the key skills for each role (e.g., design, engineering, operations). For instance:
     - **Design Persona:** Creative thinking, UX/UI design principles, knowledge of design tools.
     - **Engineering Persona:** Problem-solving, coding in specific languages, understanding of algorithms.
     - **Operations Persona:** Process optimization, project management, workflow automation.
   - **Personality Traits:** Assign personality traits to each role to give them a distinct voice. For example:
     - **Design Persona:** Innovative, empathetic, artistic.
     - **Engineering Persona:** Logical, detail-oriented, methodical.
     - **Operations Persona:** Organized, pragmatic, efficient.

**1.2 Gather Relevant Data**
   - **Sources of Data:**
     - **Books and Articles:** Extract relevant information and language style from industry-specific literature.
     - **Blogs and Social Media:** Use content from industry leaders in each field.
     - **Job Descriptions and Interviews:** Analyze job descriptions for each role, as well as interviews with experts to capture common language, phrases, and focus areas.
     - **Internal Documentation:** If available, use internal documents from your startup or similar companies.

**1.3 Synthetic Data Generation**
   - **Prompt-Based Generation:** Use a GPT model or another large language model to generate additional training data. For instance, provide prompts related to each role (e.g., "Explain the importance of UX in design") and let the model generate responses.
   - **Persona-Specific Conversations:** Generate dialogues where the persona answers common questions, discusses their field, or interacts with other roles. This will help in fine-tuning the model to handle multi-turn conversations.

### 2. **Data Structuring**

**2.1 Create a Structured Dataset**
   - **Text Segmentation:** Organize your collected data into segments (e.g., sentences, paragraphs) that represent each competency or personality trait.
   - **Labeling:** Each segment should be labeled according to its role, skill, and personality trait.
   - **Data Format:** Structure your data in a table or spreadsheet where each row represents a unique data point. Columns might include:
     - **Input Text:** The text data (e.g., question, statement, dialogue).
     - **Role:** The specific role (e.g., Design, Engineering).
     - **Skill/Competency:** The particular skill (e.g., creative thinking, coding).
     - **Personality Trait:** The assigned personality trait (e.g., empathetic, logical).

**2.2 Data Augmentation**
   - **Paraphrasing:** Use models or manual techniques to create variations of the same data points to increase the dataset size.
   - **Scenario Simulation:** Create hypothetical scenarios (e.g., a marketing crisis, a design sprint) and generate responses or actions that the persona might take.

### 3. **Converting Data to JSONL Format**

**3.1 Structure of JSONL Files**
   - Each line in the JSONL file should represent one training example. The structure typically looks like:
   ```json
   {"prompt": "<INPUT TEXT>", "completion": "<EXPECTED OUTPUT>"}
   ```
   - Example for a Design Persona:
   ```json
   {"prompt": "What are the key considerations for UX design?", "completion": "Understanding the user's needs and creating intuitive, accessible interfaces."}
   ```

**3.2 Data Transformation**
   - **Scripted Conversion:** Write a Python script (or use tools like Pandas) to convert your structured dataset (from the spreadsheet or CSV) into the JSONL format.
   - **Validation:** Ensure that each JSONL entry is well-formed, with no missing fields or syntax errors.

**3.3 Fine-Tuning-Specific Considerations**
   - **Prompt Engineering:** Make sure that your prompts are diverse and cover various aspects of the persona's role.
   - **Balanced Dataset:** Ensure the dataset is balanced in terms of different skills and traits to avoid biases in the model’s responses.

### 4. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**

**4.1 Platform Selection**
   - Choose a fine-tuning platform (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3, Cohere, Hugging Face) depending on your specific needs and budget.

**4.2 Model Configuration**
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Set up appropriate hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) for your fine-tuning process.
   - **Training Iterations:** Decide on the number of training epochs based on the size and quality of your dataset.

**4.3 Evaluation and Iteration**
   - **Test the Model:** Use unseen prompts to evaluate the model’s performance. Make sure the persona’s responses align with the expected skills and personality traits.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Adjust your dataset or fine-tuning approach based on test results to improve the model.

### 5. **Deployment and Monitoring**

**5.1 Integration with Moonshot and Other Platforms**
   - **API Deployment:** Deploy the fine-tuned models as APIs that can be called by the Moonshot platform or other applications.
   - **Persona Channels:** Integrate the models into the Discord channels, ensuring they interact in character and with the correct skill set.

**5.2 Continuous Learning**
   - **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users interacting with the personas to continually refine and update the models.
   - **Dataset Expansion:** As more data becomes available, continue to expand and refine your datasets, re-training the models as needed.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. **Start collecting and organizing data** for each role and personality.
2. **Write scripts** to transform this data into JSONL files.
3. **Begin fine-tuning** on your chosen platform, starting with one persona as a test case.

  - **Operations Persona:** Project management guides, agile methodology resources, or industry reports.

**1.2 Generating Synthetic Data**
- **Using GPT-3 for Data Generation:**
  - You can use GPT-3 or another large language model to generate additional content tailored to each persona.
  - Example Prompt for Design Persona: "Explain the importance of user-centered design in modern web applications."
  - Use the API to generate multiple variations of responses, which can help in creating a diverse dataset.

**1.3 Organizing the Data**
- **Spreadsheet Format:**
  - Create a spreadsheet with columns for "Input Text," "Role," "Skill," and "Personality Trait."
  - **Example:**
    | Input Text                                    | Role      | Skill              | Personality Trait |
    |-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|
    | "What is the key to successful UX design?"    | Designer  | UX/UI Principles    | Empathetic        |
    | "How do you optimize a web application?"      | Engineer  | Performance Tuning  | Analytical        |
    | "What are the steps for effective project management?" | Operations | Workflow Optimization | Organized    |

**Tools:**
- **Google Sheets/Excel:** Use these tools for initial data collection and organization.
- **Python/Pandas:** To transform and analyze the data programmatically.

### **2. Data Structuring and JSONL Conversion**

**2.1 Data Structuring**
- As with the initial strategy, structure your collected data into a spreadsheet or database where each row corresponds to an input-output pair. Ensure that the data is properly labeled with the role, skill, and personality traits.

**2.2 JSONL Conversion**
- **Python Script for JSONL Conversion:**
  - Since Replicate uses a similar JSONL format for data, the conversion script will be the same as before.
  - **Example Script:**
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  import json

  # Load your dataset into a DataFrame
  df = pd.read_csv('cult_coins_personas.csv')

  # Function to create JSONL lines
  def create_jsonl_line(row):
      prompt = row['Input Text']
      completion = row['Expected Output']  # This should be a field in your dataset
      return {"prompt": prompt, "completion": completion}

  # Apply the function to each row and create a JSONL formatted list
  jsonl_data = df.apply(create_jsonl_line, axis=1).tolist()

  # Save as JSONL file
  with open('design_persona.jsonl', 'w') as outfile:
      for entry in jsonl_data:
          json.dump(entry, outfile)
          outfile.write('\n')
  ```

To fine-tune an AI model so that it can effectively answer questions or generate content related to specific documentation, like Thirdweb for an engineer persona, you need to integrate the content from that documentation into your training data. Here's a detailed plan to achieve this:

### **Step 1: Extract Content from the Thirdweb Documentation**

**1.1 Automated Extraction (Web Scraping)**
- **Web Scraping Tools:** You can use tools like `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, or even browser-based tools like `Octoparse` to scrape the Thirdweb documentation.
- **API Access:** If Thirdweb provides an API for accessing their documentation, use it to download the content directly.

**Example Using Python and BeautifulSoup:**
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://portal.thirdweb.com/docs'  # Replace with the actual URL of the documentation
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Example of extracting text from paragraphs
content = ''
for paragraph in soup.find_all('p'):
    content += paragraph.text + '\n'

# Save the extracted content to a file
with open('thirdweb_documentation.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

**1.2 Manual Extraction**
- **Copy-Paste:** If the documentation is not too large, you can manually copy and paste the relevant sections into a text file.
- **PDF/Text Downloads:** If the documentation is available as a downloadable PDF or text file, you can use that directly.

### **Step 2: Preprocess the Extracted Content**

**2.1 Segmenting the Content**
- **Chunking:** Divide the content into smaller, coherent segments. Each segment should be a self-contained explanation or description that can be used as a training example.
  - **Example Chunk:** A section on "How to deploy a smart contract using Thirdweb" could be one chunk.
  
**2.2 Labeling and Structuring**
- **Define Prompts and Completions:**
  - **Prompt:** Create questions or instructions that an engineer might ask related to the documentation.
  - **Completion:** Use the extracted content as the answer or completion.

**Example Structure:**
- **Prompt:** "How do I deploy a smart contract using Thirdweb?"
- **Completion:** "To deploy a smart contract using Thirdweb, you first need to... [continue with extracted documentation content]."

**2.3 Create a JSONL File**
- Convert these structured prompts and completions into the JSONL format for fine-tuning.

**Example JSONL Entry:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "What are the steps to deploy a smart contract using Thirdweb?",
  "completion": "To deploy a smart contract using Thirdweb, follow these steps: [insert steps from documentation]."
}
```

**Python Script to Automate JSONL Creation:**
If you have segmented the text and defined prompts, you can automate the creation of JSONL files.

```python
import json

# Example data (in practice, this would be more detailed and extracted from your documentation)
data = [
    {
        "prompt": "What is the first step in deploying a contract on Thirdweb?",
        "completion": "The first step in deploying a contract on Thirdweb is to set up your project by ..."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "How does Thirdweb handle smart contract upgrades?",
        "completion": "Thirdweb allows for smart contract upgrades by using proxy contracts, which enable ..."
    }
]

# Write data to JSONL
with open('thirdweb_engineer.jsonl', 'w') as f:
    for entry in data:
        json.dump(entry, f)
        f.write('\n')
```

### **Step 3: Fine-Tune the Model on Replicate with Documentation**

**3.1 Upload the JSONL File to Replicate**
- Follow the same process outlined previously for uploading your JSONL file to Replicate.

**3.2 Fine-Tune the Model**
- Use the Thirdweb documentation-based JSONL file to fine-tune your engineer persona model. Ensure that the model understands and can generate content related to the documentation.

**3.3 Test and Iterate**
- After fine-tuning, test the model by asking it various questions that should reference the Thirdweb documentation to ensure it responds accurately.

### **Step 4: Continuous Learning and Updating**

**4.1 Continuous Data Integration**
- As Thirdweb updates its documentation, regularly scrape or manually update your dataset to include new information.

**4.2 Feedback Loop**
- Monitor how users interact with the model. If it fails to answer certain questions or provides outdated information, update your dataset and re-fine-tune the model.

**4.3 Version Control**
- Maintain version control of your fine-tuned models so that you can roll back to previous versions if needed or compare the performance of different iterations.

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Extract and segment** the relevant Thirdweb documentation.
2. **Create a structured dataset** with prompts and completions.
3. **Convert the dataset into JSONL format** and upload it to Replicate.
4. **Fine-tune your engineer persona model** using this dataset.
5. **Test the model’s performance** and iteratively improve it based on real-world feedback.

To achieve the goal of creating a private channel on your Discord for each AI persona, where you can ask questions and get replies based on the fine-tuned models from Replicate, you'll need to integrate the following components:

1. **Discord Bot**: A bot that monitors the specified Discord channels for questions.
2. **Replicate API**: Integration with Replicate to query the fine-tuned AI models.
3. **Backend Service**: A server (e.g., using Python's Flask or FastAPI) to handle communication between Discord and Replicate.

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting this up:

### **Step 1: Set Up a Discord Bot**

**1.1 Create a Discord Bot**
- **Discord Developer Portal**: Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
- **Bot Setup**: Under the "Bot" section, create a bot, and generate a token. This token will be used to authenticate your bot.

**1.2 Invite the Bot to Your Server**
- **Permissions**: Set the required permissions for the bot, such as reading messages and sending messages.
- **Invite Link**: Use the OAuth2 URL Generator in the Developer Portal to create an invite link, then use it to add the bot to your server.

### **Step 2: Set Up Private Channels for Each Persona**

**2.1 Create Private Channels**
- In your Discord server, create a private channel for each persona (e.g., `#cto-persona`, `#designer-persona`).
- **Channel Permissions**: Restrict access to these channels so only certain roles or users can interact with them.

**2.2 Assign Roles (Optional)**
- If desired, create specific roles (e.g., `@CTO`, `@Designer`) that have access to the respective private channels.

### **Step 3: Write the Bot Code**

**3.1 Install Required Libraries**
- Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install discord.py requests
  ```

**3.2 Write the Discord Bot Script**
Here's a basic Python script to create a Discord bot that listens to specific channels, sends the message content to the Replicate API, and then posts the response back to the channel.

```python
import discord
import requests

# Load your bot token from the Discord Developer Portal
DISCORD_TOKEN = 'your-discord-bot-token'
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN = 'your-replicate-api-token'
REPLICATE_MODEL_VERSION = 'your-replicate-model-version'  # Find this on Replicate's model page

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.messages = True

client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

async def query_replicate(prompt):
    url = "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Token {REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "version": REPLICATE_MODEL_VERSION,
        "input": {
            "prompt": prompt
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json().get('output', 'Error: Could not generate response')

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'We have logged in as {client.user}')

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    # Ignore messages from the bot itself
    if message.author == client.user:
        return

    # Define which channels the bot should listen to
    if message.channel.name == 'cto-persona':
        response = await query_replicate(message.content)
        await message.channel.send(response)

    elif message.channel.name == 'designer-persona':
        response = await query_replicate(message.content)
        await message.channel.send(response)

    # Add more channels and conditions as needed

client.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)
```

**How This Works:**
- **on_ready**: Logs when the bot is connected.
- **on_message**: Listens for messages in specified channels (e.g., `cto-persona`), sends the message content to Replicate, and posts the response back.

**3.3 Run the Bot**
- Save the script as `discord_bot.py`.
- Run it using Python:
  ```bash
  python discord_bot.py
  ```

### **Step 4: Testing and Refinement**

**4.1 Test the Bot**
- Send a message in the `#cto-persona` or `#designer-persona` channel. The bot should send the message to the Replicate model and post the response back into the channel.

**4.2 Refine the Model Responses**
- If the responses need improvement, revisit the fine-tuning process on Replicate. You might need to adjust the training data or parameters.

**4.3 Debugging and Error Handling**
- Add more sophisticated error handling in the bot script to manage API failures or timeouts gracefully.

**Example Error Handling:**
```python
async def query_replicate(prompt):
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad HTTP status codes
        return response.json().get('output', 'Sorry, I couldn’t generate a response.')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error querying Replicate: {e}")
        return "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to my brain right now."
```

### **Step 5: Deploying the Bot**

**5.1 Hosting Options**
- **Local Hosting:** You can run the bot on your local machine, but for reliability, consider deploying it to a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
- **Continuous Running:** Use a process manager like `pm2` or a cron job to keep the bot running continuously.

**5.2 Environment Variables**
- Store sensitive information like the Discord bot token and Replicate API token in environment variables, especially if you’re deploying to a public or shared server.

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the basic functionality** of the bot in your private Discord channels.
2. **Improve the bot's capabilities** by refining the AI model and adding more sophisticated interactions.
3. **Deploy the bot** to a reliable server to ensure it runs continuously.
4. **Monitor interactions** and gather feedback to make iterative improvements.

---

### **Step 1: Improving the Interaction Logic**

**1.1 Contextual Awareness**
- **Threaded Conversations:** Maintain context between messages in a conversation. This can be done by keeping track of the conversation history and passing it to the Replicate model to generate more relevant responses.
  
  **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  conversation_history = {}

  @client.event
  async def on_message(message):
      if message.author == client.user:
          return

      if message.channel.name in ['cto-persona', 'designer-persona']:
          # Get the history for this conversation
          if message.channel.id not in conversation_history:
              conversation_history[message.channel.id] = []

          conversation_history[message.channel.id].append(f"{message.author}: {message.content}")
          
          # Create a prompt that includes the conversation history
          full_prompt = "\n".join(conversation_history[message.channel.id]) + f"\n{message.author}: {message.content}"
          
          response = await query_replicate(full_prompt)
          conversation_history[message.channel.id].append(f"{client.user}: {response}")

          # Limit the conversation history to a reasonable length
          conversation_history[message.channel.id] = conversation_history[message.channel.id][-10:]

          await message.channel.send(response)
  ```
  This logic ensures that the bot can maintain context over several messages, improving the quality of interactions.

**1.2 Intent Recognition**
- **Custom Commands:** Enhance the bot to recognize specific commands or intents, such as `!help`, `!summary`, or `!status`. You can preprocess the message to identify these commands and handle them differently.

  **Example:**
  ```python
  if message.content.startswith('!help'):
      await message.channel.send("Here are some things you can ask me...")
  elif message.content.startswith('!summary'):
      response = await query_replicate("Summarize the last few messages.")
      await message.channel.send(response)
  else:
      # Regular processing
      response = await query_replicate(message.content)
      await message.channel.send(response)
  ```

**1.3 Personalization and Dynamic Responses**
- **User Personalization:** Tailor responses based on user roles or previous interactions. For example, if a user with a specific role asks a question, the bot could provide more detailed technical responses.

  **Example:**
  ```python
  if "admin" in [role.name for role in message.author.roles]:
      response = await query_replicate(f"[Advanced] {message.content}")
  else:
      response = await query_replicate(message.content)
  ```

**1.4 Error Handling and Retry Logic**
- Implement retry logic for network requests to Replicate, and provide meaningful error messages if the bot encounters issues.
  
  **Example:**
  ```python
  import time

  async def query_replicate(prompt):
      max_retries = 3
      for attempt in range(max_retries):
          try:
              response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data, timeout=10)
              response.raise_for_status()
              return response.json().get('output', 'Sorry, I couldn’t generate a response.')
          except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
              print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
              time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
      return "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to my brain right now."
  ```

### **Step 2: Integrating Twitter (X) Posting**

To enable your bot to send out tweets, you can use the Twitter API (now X API). Below is how you can integrate this functionality.

**2.1 Set Up Twitter API Access**
- **Create a Developer Account:** Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and create a project and an app.
- **Generate API Keys:** Obtain your API key, API secret key, Access token, and Access token secret.

**2.2 Install Twitter API Library**
- Install the `tweepy` library, which is a Python wrapper for the Twitter API.
  ```bash
  pip install tweepy
  ```

**2.3 Write Code to Send Tweets**
- Use the `tweepy` library to post tweets from the bot.

  **Example:**
  ```python
  import tweepy

  # Twitter API credentials
  consumer_key = 'your-consumer-key'
  consumer_secret = 'your-consumer-secret'
  access_token = 'your-access-token'
  access_token_secret = 'your-access-token-secret'

  # Authenticate to Twitter
  auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)
  api = tweepy.API(auth)

  def tweet_message(message):
      try:
          api.update_status(message)
          print("Tweeted successfully!")
      except tweepy.TweepError as e:
          print(f"Error tweeting: {e}")

  # Example usage: Tweet when a message is posted in a specific channel
  @client.event
  async def on_message(message):
      if message.author == client.user:
          return

      if message.channel.name == 'cto-persona':
          response = await query_replicate(message.content)
          await message.channel.send(response)
          
          # Example condition to send a tweet
          if "deploy" in message.content.lower():
              tweet_message(f"New update from CTO persona: {response}")
  ```

**2.4 Trigger Tweets Based on Certain Events**
- You can choose specific conditions under which the bot will tweet, such as specific keywords, commands, or based on responses that are particularly important.

### **Step 3: Deployment and Continuous Improvement**

**3.1 Deploying the Bot with Twitter Integration**
- Ensure your bot is securely storing API keys, perhaps using environment variables or a secrets management service.

**3.2 Monitor and Refine**
- Monitor the interactions on Discord and the tweets to ensure that they are meaningful and effective. Adjust the logic based on feedback and observed performance.

**3.3 Continuous Learning**
- Based on user interactions, update the training data for your models and re-fine-tune them periodically to keep the responses relevant and accurate.

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Test and refine** the improved interaction logic on Discord.
2. **Integrate Twitter posting** and test it with real-world scenarios.
3. **Deploy the enhanced bot** and monitor its performance across both Discord and Twitter.

To achieve the functionality where only the Discord replies from AI agents with the most likes get tweeted, and to limit the number of tweets to 10 per day, you'll need to implement a few key features in your bot:

### **Step 1: Track Likes on Messages**
First, we need to monitor and store the number of "likes" (typically represented as reactions on Discord) that each AI-generated message receives.

**1.1 Modify the Discord Bot to Track Reactions**
- Use the `on_reaction_add` event in the Discord bot to keep track of the number of likes a message receives.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Dictionary to store message ID and like counts
message_likes = defaultdict(int)

@client.event
async def on_reaction_add(reaction, user):
    if user != client.user and reaction.emoji == '👍':  # Assuming 👍 is the "like" emoji
        message_likes[reaction.message.id] += 1
```

### **Step 2: Select the Most Liked Replies for Tweeting**
You'll need to regularly check which AI-generated messages have the most likes, and then tweet the top ones, up to a maximum of 10 tweets per day.

**2.1 Schedule Daily Tweeting**
- You can use Python's `schedule` library to run a job that selects the top messages at a specific time each day and tweets them.

```python
import schedule
import time
from datetime import datetime

daily_tweet_count = 0
MAX_TWEETS_PER_DAY = 10

def tweet_top_messages():
    global daily_tweet_count
    if daily_tweet_count >= MAX_TWEETS_PER_DAY:
        return
    
    # Sort messages by like count
    sorted_messages = sorted(message_likes.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Tweet the top messages (up to the max per day)
    for message_id, like_count in sorted_messages:
        if daily_tweet_count < MAX_TWEETS_PER_DAY:
            message = await client.get_message(message_id)
            tweet_message(message.content)
            daily_tweet_count += 1
        else:
            break

    # Reset for the next day
    daily_tweet_count = 0
    message_likes.clear()

# Schedule the function to run every day at midnight
schedule.every().day.at("00:00").do(tweet_top_messages)

# Run the scheduler in the background
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

**2.2 Implement the `tweet_message` Function**
- This function will post the selected messages to Twitter, using the `tweepy` library as discussed earlier.

```python
def tweet_message(content):
    try:
        api.update_status(content)
        print("Tweeted successfully!")
    except tweepy.TweepError as e:
        print(f"Error tweeting: {e}")
```

### **Step 3: Limit Tweets to 10 Per Day**
- The logic in `tweet_top_messages` ensures that no more than 10 tweets are sent per day by checking `daily_tweet_count`.

### **Step 4: Deploy the Bot**
- Once you’ve coded these features, you can deploy the bot as you would normally. Ensure it's running continuously to monitor likes and handle the tweeting at the scheduled time.

### **Step 5: Monitoring and Refinement**
- Monitor the bot’s performance, ensuring it tweets the most liked messages as intended. Adjust the `on_reaction_add` and `tweet_top_messages` logic if necessary.

### **Key Considerations:**
- **Edge Cases**: Consider what happens if multiple messages have the same number of likes. You may need to implement additional logic to handle ties, like prioritizing newer messages.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling for both Discord and Twitter API interactions to manage rate limits and other potential issues.
- **Scaling**: If your Discord server grows, you may need to optimize how you store and sort reactions, especially if tracking many messages simultaneously.
